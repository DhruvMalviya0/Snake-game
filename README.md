## üåç Deploying the Game to the Web (Using pygbag & Vercel)

1. **Ensure Pygbag is Installed**
   ```sh
   pip install pygbag
   ```
2. **Move `main.py` to a Web-Friendly Folder**
   ```sh
   mkdir snake_game_web
   mv main.py snake_game_web/
   cd snake_game_web
   ```
3. **Run Pygbag**
   ```sh
   python -m pygbag .
   ```
4. **Build for Web Deployment**
   ```sh
   python -m pygbag --build .
   ```
   The final game files will be available inside `build/web/`.
5. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - In Vercel's project settings, set:
     - **Install Command**:
       ```sh
       pip install pygbag
       ```
     - **Build Command**:
       ```sh
       python -m pygbag --build .
       ```
     - **Output Directory**:
       ```
       build/web
       ```
6. **Host the Game Online**
   Upload the `build/web/` folder to Vercel or other static hosting services like **GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Itch.io**.

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

- If `pygame` fails to install, try updating `pip`:
  ```sh
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
- If assets are missing, ensure the `Graphics/`, `Sound/`, and `Font/` folders are correctly placed in the project directory.
- If the game is lagging, try reducing the `clock.tick(144)` value inside `main.py`.
